# COSC242 - Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment you will expand and modify code written during the labs to produce a single program, which can use either a hash table or a tree data structure, to perform various tasks. The program can be used to process two groups of words. The first group of words will be read from stdin and will be inserted into the data structure. The second group of words will be read from a file specified on the command line. If any word read from the file is not contained in the data structure then it should get printed to stdout
